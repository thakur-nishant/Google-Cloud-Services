Programming Assignment 6
 Performance

Description:
 Frequently cloud service based systems need to support thousands or even millions
 of users (or subscribers) often simultaneously. In order to more accurately model
 these type of systems, one needs to employ traffic modeling systems that can both
 create events as well as measure responses.

Using assignment 2 or 3 (or any other assignment you wish) as a template, or “driver”,
you need to create a cloud based system that responds to user queries and that (on the
“cloud”) performs simple database queries and formats a web interface response to the
user. You will test (exercise) that system remotely, from your PC, and gather performance
metrics. “Jmeter” is one (free) software tool that will provide the needed features,
others will work well, too.
1. Create/implement a cloud based web site similar to assignment 2 or 3, or any that
 responds to user queries, retrieving information from a relational database.
2. Test your implementation.
3. Obtain Jmeter (or similar), install, test your understanding.
4. Use Jmeter to drive your cloud application. Try several parameters, such as
 amount of requests per unit time, intervals between requests, and similar variations
 on request traffic.
5. Get, and interpret, results.
